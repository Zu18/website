# My website
The HTML and CSS responsive website with information about me and my portfolio. To build this website I used vanilla(plain) JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. During the work on this project, I learned:

1. About the position property and how to position  an element at the page.
2. How to use the z-index property to specify the stack order of an element.
3. How to link navbar menu with sections of the page.
4. How to fix the permanent position of an element (navbar) using the scrollTop property and the scroll event.
