        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Zukhra. At 34 years old, I find myself in a stage of life filled with excitement, growth, and
            exploration. Alongside me are my amazing 9-year-old daughter and my loving spouse, who bring joy and
            adventure into my world. Together, we navigate the ups and downs of life, supporting each other and creating
            cherished memories.
            Originally I am from Russia. I graduated with honors from a Russian university. That helped me to start my
            career as a consumer loan officer in the largest regional bank. My job was to evaluate loan applications.
            After two years I grew into a team leader of 5 people. Then, I continued my career in a different bank where
            I had a team of 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            Four years ago, I made the life-changing decision to move to the UK. Since then, I've been captivated by the
            diverse landscapes and cultures of this country. I've made it a priority to dedicate several weekends each
            month to exploring different corners of the UK. From tranquil natural landscapes to vibrant cityscapes, I
            enjoy each journey and appreciate for the beauty that surrounds me.<br>
            But my journey doesn't end there. I'm on a quest for personal and professional growth. I've set my sights on
            becoming a software developer, immersing myself in the world of programming. Age is merely a number, and I
            firmly believe that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.

                <p style="margin-top: 0%;">
                    Previously, I worked in a bank. However, when I relocated, I realized that I had to start my
                    career from scratch. And I thought why not try something new?
                    I found that the QA job is quite similar to follow-up control work that I had in a bank before.
                    Moreover, I really loved this part of my job.
                    I began learning about quality assurance (QA) as a potential career path. However, during my
                    learning journey, I discovered the importance of having a foundation in programming for testers.
                    Intrigued by this new aspect, I decided to delve into programming and started learning the basics. I
                    did not know that this decision would ignite a passion within me.
                    The more I learned about programming, the more I fell in love with it. I became captivated by the
                    ability to create something that people can use and benefit from. The idea of contributing to the
                    development of applications, websites, and systems that have a real-world impact fascinated me.

                        Memory Game is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turning over 2 cards at a

                        This app, created during my time at Founders and Coders, is a collaborative effort with another
                        student. About the app:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Access to Global Earthquake Data:</b> Quake Finder utilizes two distinct APIs. The first
                            API,
                            provided by the USGS, enables users to retrieve information about earthquakes worldwide
                            based on latitude, longitude, period, radius, and other parameters. The second API is used
                            to convert city names into latitude and longitude coordinates. Together, they offer a
                            comprehensive view of earthquake activity.</li>
                        <li><b>Search and Filtering:</b> Users have the ability to interact with the app. They can
                            input parameters such as city names, start dates, end dates, and select a radius. Upon
                            submitting the form, the app will generate a table containing information about all
                            earthquakes in the specified area and time period. The table includes details about the
                            location, date/time, and magnitude of each earthquake. Additionally, users can sort the
                            table in both ascending and descending order based on magnitude and date by clicking on the
                            header of the relevant column.</li>
                        <li> <b>Responsive Design:</b> Quake Finder has been designed with a responsive, mobile-first
                            approach,
                            ensuring proper functionality on a range of devices and screen sizes.</li>
